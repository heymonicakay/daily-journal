Sprint expectations:

**Sprint Planning**
- Discuss scope of the work to be done during sprint.
- Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint.
- Prepare sprint backlog that includes work needed to complete the selected backlog items
- Agree on the sprint goal - a short description of the forecasted end of sprint deliverables.
- First half: What do we believe we can complete in this sprint?
- Second half: Identifying the detailed work (tasks) required to do so.
        - As detailed work is elaborated, some product items may be split, combined, or put aside if the team no longer believes they can reasonably complete the required work in a single sprint.
- Forecast by voting, which tasks will actually be delivered within the sprint.

                     <p> 1. What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal? </p>
                     <p> 2. What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal? </p>
                     <p> 3. Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal? </p>
                     <p> > _Note: Impediments identified in the daily scrum are captured on team's `scrum board`. A designated team member agrees to work towards a resolution._ </p>
